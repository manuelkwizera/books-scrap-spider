# Web Scraping With Scrapy and MongoDB

This project demonstrates how to build a scalable web scraper using Scrapy, a powerful Python framework, and store the extracted data in MongoDB, a flexible NoSQL database.

## Features

- **Scrapy Integration**: Leverage Scrapy's asynchronous capabilities to efficiently crawl and parse website content.
- **MongoDB Storage**: Store scraped data in MongoDB, allowing for scalable and flexible data management.
- **ETL Workflow**: Implement an Extract, Transform, Load process to clean and store data systematically.
- **Pagination Handling**: Navigate through multi-page websites to ensure comprehensive data collection.
- **Duplicate Management**: Prevent duplicate entries in MongoDB by creating unique identifiers for each item.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Utilize Scrapy's built-in tools and Python's unittest framework to test and debug spiders.
- **Anti-Scraping Measures**: Configure user-agent rotation, request delays, and respect robots.txt to handle common web scraping challenges.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Scrapy**:

   ```bash
   pip install scrapy
   ```

2. **Create a Scrapy Project**:

   ```bash
   scrapy startproject books
   ```

3. **Define Items**:
   In `books/items.py`, define the data structure for the items you plan to scrape.
4. **Create a Spider**:
   Implement your spider in `books/spiders/`, specifying how to crawl and parse the target website.
5. **Set Up MongoDB**:

   - Install MongoDB on your system.
   - In `books/settings.py`, add:

     ```python
     MONGO_URI = "mongodb://localhost:27017"
     MONGO_DATABASE = "books_db"
     ```

6. **Implement Pipelines**:
   In `books/pipelines.py`, create a pipeline to process and store items in MongoDB.
7. **Configure Settings**:
   Enable your pipeline in `books/settings.py`:

   ```python
   ITEM_PIPELINES = {
       'books.pipelines.MongoPipeline': 300,
   }
   ```

8. **Run the Spider**:

   ```bash
   scrapy crawl book
   ```

## Testing

- **Spider Contracts**: Use docstring annotations to define expected behavior and validate spider methods.
- **Unit Tests**: Implement tests using Python's `unittest` framework to ensure your scraper functions as intended.

## Handling Anti-Scraping Measures

- **User-Agent Rotation**: Rotate user-agent strings to mimic different browsers.
- **Request Delays**: Introduce delays between requests to avoid overwhelming the target server.
- **Robots.txt Compliance**: Ensure your scraper respects the target site's `robots.txt` rules.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can build a robust web scraper that efficiently collects and stores data from websites using Scrapy and MongoDB. This setup is scalable and can be adapted to various web scraping projects.
